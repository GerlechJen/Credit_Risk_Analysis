# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of oversampling and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Also, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 




## Results


## Summary

youâ€™ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
